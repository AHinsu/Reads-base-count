# Reads-base-count

This is a sheel script created to count the bases and reads from the paired fastq files. This script assumes that you prinseq-lite.pl script is present in PATH or needs to be in the working directory (along with fastq files) with executable permission.

The fastq files should be gzipped and should have the naming convention as 'Sample-name_R1.fastq.gz'. There should not be any "_" in the Sample-name.
